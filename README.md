## Design

### Design Choices
The layout I chose ensures each specific point of information is easy to access and follows a similar theme to ensure continuity. Tooting boxing club is a new, high end and authentic boxing gym so I want the website to be slick and clean to represent that.

### Colour
As Tooting Boxing Club is a club that is influenced by the past, I wanted to add hints of authentic and classic colour (yellow and red) used in boxing posters from the 70's and 80's - a truly classic era of boxing.

The branding colours I chose are Black, White, A slightly Mustard Yellow and a Burnt Red.

Primary Colours - Black / White

Secondary Colours - Yellow / Red

Black, Yellow and white being the most predominant as they stand out so well against each other.

I also use subtle greys when a white background to too garish.

Specific colours used on the site all taken from a colour picker in InDesign are;
1. Black: #000000
2. White: #ffffff
3. Off-white: #f1f1f1 
4. Off-white: 2 #C0C0C0 (also used for Silver)
5. Yellow: #e9c431
6. Red: #a51e1e
7. Shadow Grey: #726a6a
8. Subtle Grey: #807c7c (only used for a very small amount of text on - 'Read Me' on index.html reviews section)
9. Bronze: #CD7F32

I tested multiple options on indesign to ensure I was happy with the colours and had covered as many other options I also liked.

### Fonts

Google fonts were used to import the 'Martian Mono and Nunito Sans' font used throughout the website:
- [Martian Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Martian+Mono?query=martian)
- [Nunito Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito+Sans?query=nunito+sans)

Martian Mono only used for title headers as they stand out well being a slightly and make an impact as the user lands on the page.
<br> 
I use these fonts as they are clean, easy to read and have a smart appearance and as they are not a commonly used fonts still manage to portray a unique and individual look to them.

### Structure
The page is structure in a user friendly and visually appealing way. Upon arriving the user will notice the recognisable navigation bar, with the company logo on the left and next to that a WhatsApp symbol for quick and convenient contact via the app, all navigation links are placed on the right.

The website consists of six separate pages and a ‘Sign In’ modal: 
- A homepage with a sections giving more information on the club (Strapline and short introduction, gallery, reviews and map)
- An About page with information on the founders and why they started the club.
- A Team page that introduces the user to the coaches.
- A Prices page with details on the different options for classes and 1-1’s.
- A Class Schedule page with the class timetable and details on the different class the gym puts on via a modal.
- A Contact page with a form for getting in touch.
- The Sign In icon takes the user to a sign in modal, there is no page.

## Bugs

1. Buttons on index.html hero image

   A. Having tested their position on all devices, I notcied using a margin of a specific px cause them to be out of place on different devices. Using an 'rem' unit paired with specific media queries commands instead allows them repsond better ensuring they are in a good posotion on all devices.


##### CSS Edits
```css
            .hero-btn {
                display: block;
                text-align: center;
                z-index: 1;
                position: absolute;
                margin-top: 15rem; (originally used a pixel unit here)
            }
```
##### Media Query commands
```css
        @media screen and (min-width:820px) and (max-width:912px){
            .hero-btn{
                margin-top: 20em;
            }

        @media screen and (max-width:480px)
            .btn.btn-dark {
                width: 125px;
            }
            .hero-btn {
                font-weight: none;
            }

        @media screen and (max-width:280px)
            .hero-btn {
                margin-top: 175px;
            }
            .btn.btn-dark{
                margin-bottom: 10px;
            }
            .hero img {
                height: 15vh;
                margin-bottom: 25px;
            }
```

    B. Having looked at ths in more detail it just wasn't working correclty, it caused the logo and buttons to be at different positions on lots of different devices and was messy. I decided to re-write the code and see if there was a different way of doing it. I found a solution here is the old code and the new;

#### Old HTML
```html
            <div class="hero">
                <div class="container-fuild">
                    <img src="assets/images/logo-05.png" alt="Tooting Boxing Club boxing gloves logo">
                </div>
                <div class="hero-button text-center">
                    <a href="prices.html" class="button">Buy Now</a>
                    <a href="schedule.html" class="button">Book Now</a>
                </div>
            </div>
```
##### New HTML
```html
            <div class="hero">
                <div class="container-fuild hero-content">
                    <img src="assets/images/logo-05.png" alt="Tooting Boxing Club boxing gloves logo">
                    <div class="hero-button">
                        <a href="prices.html" class="button">Buy Now</a>
                        <a href="schedule.html" class="button">Book Now</a>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
```
#### Old CSS
```css
            .hero img {
                align-items: center;
                height: 20vh;
            }

            .hero-button {
                display: block;
                text-align: center;
                position: absolute;
                top: 75%;
            }

            .button {
                width: 150px;
                margin-left: 10px;
                margin-right: 10px;
            }
```
#### New CSS
```css
            .hero-content {
                display: flex;
                text-align: center;
                align-items: center;
                flex-direction: column;
                z-index: 1;
            }

            .hero-content img {
                display: block;
                height: 185px;
                width: 195px;
            }

            .hero-button {
                display: block;
                text-align: center;
            }
```

Which meant i could remove all the messy media queries and write just one for when the screen width was really thin;
```css
            @media screen and (max-width:282px){
                .hero-button .button{
                margin-bottom: 10px;
                }
            }           
```
2. Map

The map had a grey line under so wasn't flush to the footer, after using google inspect I noticed the container was a different height the map so matched both heights to 400px which fixed the issue.

#### Orginal code
```css
            .map {
                height: 400px;
                width: 100%;
            }
```
#### Code fix
```css
            .map {
                height: 400px;
                width: 100%;
            }

            .map iframe {
                height: 400px;
                width: 100%;
                }
```
3. Schedule

Overflow scroll wasn't working correctly on scheudle page, noticed the way I'd set up the media query seemed to be the issue and it was also affecting the header and footer. Fixed the issue by changing to max-width instead of min-width of the media query and moving the units, which resovled both issues.

#### Orginal code

``` css
        @media screen and (min-width: 900px){
            .table{
                overflow-x: auto;}
            }       
```

#### Code fix

``` css
        @media screen and (max-width: 1428px){
            .table{
                overflow-x: auto;}
            }
```

I then ran into more problems as the scroll was working but but the buttons were squashing as the container width changed with the screen. To fix this I added a fixed min-width to the table in the same media query above so it now is written as;

#### **Code fix**
```css
       @media screen and (max-width: 1428px){
            .table {
                overflow-x: auto;
            }
            .schedule-style{
                min-width: 1320px;
            }
        }
```
