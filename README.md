## Testing User Stories from User Experiencer 

• First time visitor goals

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub using the following stages;

### Forking the GitHub Repository

### Making a Local Clone

## Further Testing 

• The webiste was tested on Google Chrome, firefox, Safari.....
• The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Mobile Phone (apple and android) and tablets

## Known bugs

#### Index.html

• Buttons
    Having tested their position on all devices, I notcied using a margin of a specific px cause them to be out of place on different devices. Using an 'EM' unit paired with media queries instead allows them repsond better ensuring they are in a good posotion on all devices. 

• Map
    The map had a grey line under so wasn't flush to the footer, after using google inspect I noticed the container was a different height the map so matched both heights to 400px which fixed the issue.

• Schedule
    Overflow scroll wasn't working correctly on scheudle page, noticed the way media query was working seemed to be the issue and it was also affecting the footer. Fixed the issue by chaing the max-width of the media query which resovled both issues.
