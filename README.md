### **Project Goals**

Primary goal is to provide an informative good looking website that showcases Tooting Boxing Club and encourages the user to come to the gym, buy classes or 1-1's or get in touch via the website.


### **User Goals**

The target audience is from 16 and up and for any gender.

User goals are:

- A well displayed easy to navigate website.
- Clear indication to what we and who we are and what's on offer.
- Easy access to get in touch for more information.
- Visual diplay of the club to help user see and get and feel for the gym.
- Call to action buttons to allow a user friendly experience buying and booking classes.
- Enough information on the club, owners, coaches and classes for the user to have a good undertsanding of the company and it's employees.


### **Developer and Business Goals**

- A clean design that stands out and catches the users attention.
- A website that responds correclty on all devices where design and effectivness is not hindered on any device.
- An easy to navigate website with clear pathwasy to specific pages such as class booking, prices and information on the club and coaches.
- A project the developer would be proud to display in their portfolio.


### **User Stories**

- The main goal for the useris t be encouraged to either get in touch, make a purchase, book in a class or gather more information on the club.
- The site should be visually appealling, neatly laid out with an attract colour system.
- The user should easily be ablt to find the prices, coaches and then find which coaches are coaching on the schedule.
- The schedule needs to be able to give further information about the specific classes that are on each day for the user to know more about what they are booking in to.
- If the user wants to know more or has any further questions, simpes means to contact must be visable.


### **Design Choices**

I took inspiration from what I saw in the competitors sites I liked and as Tooting Boxing Club is a club that is influenced by the past I wanted to add hints of authentic and classic colours used in boxing posters from the 70's and 80's - a truly classic era of boxing.

The branding colours I chose are Black, White, A slightly Mustard Yellow and a Burnt Red.

Primary Colours - Black / White

Secondary Colours - Yellow / Red

Black, Yellow and white being the most promodinant as they stand out so well against each other.

I will also use subtle greys when a white backlground to too garish.

### **Fonts**

- Google fonts were used to import the 'Martian Mono and Nunito Sans' font used throughout the website:
- [Martian Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Martian+Mono?query=martian)
- [Nunito Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito+Sans?query=nunito+sans)
- I use these fonts as they are clean, easy to read and have a smart appearance and as they are not a commonly used font still manage to portray a unique and individual look to them.


#### **Icons**

- All icons used were chosen to reflect the specifc site or page they represent (instagram icon for link ot instagram) allowing an easy understanding for everyone using the site.

#### **Colours**

- specific colours used on the site all taking from a colour picker in InDesign are;
    1. Black: #000000
    2. White: #ffffff
    3. Off-white: #f1f1f1 
    4. Off-white: 2 #C0C0C0 (also used for Silver)
    5. Yellow: #e9c431
    6. Red: #a51e1e
    7. Shadow Grey: #726a6a
    8. Sublte Grey: #807c7c (only used for a very small amount of text on - 'Read Me' on index.html reviews section)
    9. Bronze: #CD7F32

### **Styling**

- Buttons are consistently rectangular with rounded corners and soft hover feature for aesthetics. 
- All profile images have a white border and sublte shadow as this makes them pop out of the page, stand out as it makes them a little different from just being a straight edged photo.
- Boxes have squared corners throughout ensuring consistency and separates them from the buttons and profile images helping them to standout and have a strong presence.
- Each page folows one of two themes, light background with dark text or dark background with light text. This is to ensure their aren't too many differently styled pages and that both stand out with the context popping off the page. 

### **Backgrounds**

- The only background image used is on the index.html as the hero image it was chosen as it shows 2 gloves coming together which is a symbol of repsect, unity and companionship. all of whic the club stands for.
- All over backgrounds are either an off-white as white is too garish or black.

## **Known bugs**

1. Buttons on index.html hero image

    Having tested their position on all devices, I notcied using a margin of a specific px cause them to be out of place on different devices. Using an 'rem' unit paired with specific media queries commands instead allows them repsond better ensuring they are in a good posotion on all devices.

##### **CSS Edits**
            .hero-btn {
                display: block;
                text-align: center;
                z-index: 1;
                position: absolute;
                margin-top: 15rem; (originally used a pixel unit here)
            }

##### **Media Query commands**

        @media screen and (min-width:820px) and (max-width:912px){
            .hero-btn{
                margin-top: 20em;
            }

        @media screen and (max-width:480px)
            .btn.btn-dark {
                width: 125px;
            }
            .hero-btn {
                font-weight: none;
            }

        @media screen and (max-width:280px)
            .hero-btn {
                margin-top: 175px;
            }
            .btn.btn-dark{
                margin-bottom: 10px;
            }
            .hero img {
                height: 15vh;
                margin-bottom: 25px;
            }

2. Map

The map had a grey line under so wasn't flush to the footer, after using google inspect I noticed the container was a different height the map so matched both heights to 400px which fixed the issue.

#### **Orginal code**

            .map {
                height: 400px;
                width: 100%;
            }

#### **Code fix**

            .map {
                height: 400px;
                width: 100%;
            }

            .map iframe {
                height: 400px;
                width: 100%;
                }

3. Schedule

Overflow scroll wasn't working correctly on scheudle page, noticed the way I'd set up the media query seemed to be the issue and it was also affecting the header and footer. Fixed the issue by changing to max-width instead of min-width of the media query and moving the units, which resovled both issues.

#### **Orginal code**

        @media screen and (min-width: 900px){
            .table{
                overflow-x: auto;}
            }       


#### **Code fix**

        @media screen and (max-width: 1428px){
            .table{
                overflow-x: auto;}
            }
