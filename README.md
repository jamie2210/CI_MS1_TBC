### **Design Choices**

I took inspiration from what I saw in the competitors sites I liked and as Tooting Boxing Club is a club that is influenced by the past I wanted to add hints of authentic and classic colours used in boxing posters from the 70's and 80's - a truly classic era of boxing.

The branding colours I chose are Black, White, A slightly Mustard Yellow and a Burnt Red.

Primary Colours - Black / White

Secondary Colours - Yellow / Red

Black, Yellow and white being the most promodinant as they stand out so well against each other.

I will also use subtle greys when a white backlground to too garish.

### **Branding & Research**

### **Fonts**

- Google fonts were used to import the 'Martian Mono and Nunito Sans' font used throughout the website:
- [Martian Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Martian+Mono?query=martian)
- [Nunito Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito+Sans?query=nunito+sans)
- I use these fonts as they are clean, easy to read and have a smart appearance and as they are not a commonly used font still manage to portray a unique and individual look to them.


#### **Icons**

- All icons used were chosen to reflect the specifc site or page they represent (instagram icon for link ot instagram) allowing an easy understanding for everyone using the site.

#### **Colours**

- specific colours used on the site all taking from a colour picker in InDesign are;
    1. Black: #000000
    2. White: #ffffff
    3. Off-white: #f1f1f1 
    4. Off-white: 2 #C0C0C0 (also used for Silver)
    5. Yellow: #e9c431
    6. Red: #a51e1e
    7. Shadow Grey: #726a6a
    8. Sublte Grey: #807c7c (only used for a very small amount of text on - 'Read Me' on index.html reviews section)
    9. Bronze: #CD7F32

### **Styling**

- Buttons are consistently rectangular with rounded corners and soft hover feature for aesthetics. 
- All profile images have a white border and sublte shadow as this makes them pop out of the page, stand out as it makes them a little different from just being a straight edged photo.
- Boxes have squared corners throughout ensuring consistency and separates them from the buttons and profile images helping them to standout and have a strong presence.
- Each page folows one of two themes, light background with dark text or dark background with light text. This is to ensure their aren't too many differently styled pages and that both stand out with the context popping off the page. 

### **Backgrounds**

- The only background image used is on the index.html as the hero image it was chosen as it shows 2 gloves coming together which is a symbol of repsect, unity and companionship. all of whic the club stands for.
- All over backgrounds are either an off-white as white is too garish or black.

## **Known bugs**

1. Buttons on index.html hero image

   A. Having tested their position on all devices, I notcied using a margin of a specific px cause them to be out of place on different devices. Using an 'rem' unit paired with specific media queries commands instead allows them repsond better ensuring they are in a good posotion on all devices.

    ##### **CSS Edits**
            .hero-btn {
                display: block;
                text-align: center;
                z-index: 1;
                position: absolute;
                margin-top: 15rem; (originally used a pixel unit here)
            }

    ##### **Media Query commands**

        @media screen and (min-width:820px) and (max-width:912px){
            .hero-btn{
                margin-top: 20em;
            }

        @media screen and (max-width:480px)
            .btn.btn-dark {
                width: 125px;
            }
            .hero-btn {
                font-weight: none;
            }

        @media screen and (max-width:280px)
            .hero-btn {
                margin-top: 175px;
            }
            .btn.btn-dark{
                margin-bottom: 10px;
            }
            .hero img {
                height: 15vh;
                margin-bottom: 25px;
            }

    B. Having looked at ths in more detail it just wasn't working correclty, it caused the logo and buttons to be at different positions on lots of different devices and was messy. I decided to re-write the code and see if there was a different way of doing it. I found a solution here is the old code and the new;

#### Old HTML

            <div class="hero">
                <div class="container-fuild">
                    <img src="assets/images/logo-05.png" alt="Tooting Boxing Club boxing gloves logo">
                </div>
                <div class="hero-button text-center">
                    <a href="prices.html" class="button">Buy Now</a>
                    <a href="schedule.html" class="button">Book Now</a>
                </div>
            </div>

##### New HTML

        <div class="hero">
            <div class="container-fuild hero-content">
                <img src="assets/images/logo-05.png" alt="Tooting Boxing Club boxing gloves logo">
                <div class="hero-button">
                    <a href="prices.html" class="button">Buy Now</a>
                    <a href="schedule.html" class="button">Book Now</a>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

#### Old CSS

            .hero img {
                align-items: center;
                height: 20vh;
            }

            .hero-button {
                display: block;
                text-align: center;
                position: absolute;
                top: 75%;
            }

            .button {
                width: 150px;
                margin-left: 10px;
                margin-right: 10px;
            }

#### New CSS

            .hero-content {
                display: flex;
                lex-direction: column;
                z-index: 1;
            }

            .hero img {
                height: 180px;
                width: auto;
            }

            .hero-button {
                display: block;
                text-align: center;
                display: block;
            }

Which meant i could remove all the messy media queries and write just one for when the screen width was really thin;

            @media screen and (max-width:282px){
                .hero-button .button{
                margin-bottom: 10px;
                }
            }           


2. Map

The map had a grey line under so wasn't flush to the footer, after using google inspect I noticed the container was a different height the map so matched both heights to 400px which fixed the issue.

#### **Orginal code**

            .map {
                height: 400px;
                width: 100%;
            }

#### **Code fix**

            .map {
                height: 400px;
                width: 100%;
            }

            .map iframe {
                height: 400px;
                width: 100%;
                }

3. Schedule

Overflow scroll wasn't working correctly on scheudle page, noticed the way I'd set up the media query seemed to be the issue and it was also affecting the header and footer. Fixed the issue by changing to max-width instead of min-width of the media query and moving the units, which resovled both issues.

#### **Orginal code**

        @media screen and (min-width: 900px){
            .table{
                overflow-x: auto;}
            }       


#### **Code fix**

        @media screen and (max-width: 1428px){
            .table{
                overflow-x: auto;}
            }

I then ran into more problems as the scroll was working but but the buttons were squashing as the container width changed with the screen. To fix this I added a fixed min-width to the table in the same media query above so it now is written as;

#### **Code fix**

       @media screen and (max-width: 1428px){
            .table {
                overflow-x: auto;
            }
            .schedule-style{
                min-width: 1320px;
            }
        }
